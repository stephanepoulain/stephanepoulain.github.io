I recently completed my PhD at the University of Oslo in April in [Andreas Carlson's group](https://acarlson-uio.github.io/).
My primary focus was on lubrication flows, where I combined theory and numerics to study the coupling between viscous forces and capillary or elastic systems. I also performed experiments inspired by fog harvesting on the behavior of water droplets on fibers.

Before coming to Oslo, I received a Dipl. Ing. in Aerospace Engineering from ISAE-Supaero, France. I gained research experience through internships, working experimentally with [Sunny Jung](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/sunnyjsh) (then at Virginia Tech) on cavitation bubbles and with [Lucas Brandt](https://www.mech.kth.se/~luca/index.php) and [Gaetano Sardina](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/sardina/) at KTH Stockholm simulating numerically the growth of rain droplets in clouds. I then pursued a Masterâ€™s Degree in Civil & Environmental Engineering at MIT, where I studied experimentally surface bubbles in the context of (bio)aerosol generation.
