  abstract={Unsteady fragmentation of a fluid bulk into droplets is important for epidemiology as it governs the transport of pathogens from sneezes and coughs, or from contaminated crops in agriculture. It is also ubiquitous in industrial processes such as paint, coating, and combustion. Unsteady fragmentation is distinct from steady fragmentation on which most theoretical efforts have been focused thus far. We address this gap by studying a canonical unsteady fragmentation process: the breakup from a drop impact on a finite surface where the drop fluid is transferred to a free expanding sheet of time-varying properties and bounded by a rim of time-varying thickness. The continuous rim destabilization selects the final spray droplets, yet this process remains poorly understood. We combine theory with advanced image analysis to study the unsteady rim destabilization. We show that, at all times, the rim thickness is governed by a local instantaneous Bond number equal to unity, defined with the instantaneous, local, unsteady rim acceleration. This criterion is found to be robust and universal for a family of unsteady inviscid fluid sheet fragmentation phenomena, from impacts of drops on various surface geometries to impacts on films. We discuss under which viscous and viscoelastic conditions the criterion continues to govern the unsteady rim thickness.},

  abstract={Gravitational settling of a droplet in air onto a soft substrate is a ubiquitous event relevant to many natural processes and engineering applications. We study this phenomenon by developing a three-phase lubrication model of droplet settling onto a solid substrate coated by a thin soft layer represented by a viscous film, an elastic compressible layer and an elastic sheet supported by a viscous film. By combining scaling analysis, analytical methods and numerical simulations we elucidate how the resulting droplet dynamics is affected by the nature of the soft layer. We show that these soft layers can significantly affect the droplet shape during gravitational settling. When there is a linear response of the deformations of the soft layer, the air layer takes longer to drain as compared with the case of a droplet settling onto a rigid substrate. Our results provide new insight into the coupled interactions between droplets and solids coated by a thin film of a soft material.},

  abstract={Adhesive contact between a thin elastic sheet and a substrate arises in a range of biological, physical and technological applications. By considering the dynamics of this process that naturally couples fluid flow, long-wavelength elastic deformations and microscopic adhesion, we analyse a sixth-order thin-film equation for the short-time dynamics of the onset of adhesion and the long-time dynamics of a steadily propagating adhesion front. Numerical solutions corroborate scaling laws and asymptotic analyses for the characteristic waiting time for adhesive contact and for the speed of the adhesion front. A similarity analysis of the governing partial differential equation further allows us to determine the shape of a fluid-filled blister ahead of the adhesion front. Finally, our analysis reveals a near-singular behaviour at the moving elastohydrodynamic contact line with an effective boundary condition that might be useful in other related problems.},

  abstract={We study experimentally the dynamics of a water droplet on a tilted and vertically oscillating rigid fibre. As we vary the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations the droplet transitions between different modes: harmonic pumping, subharmonic pumping, a combination of rocking and pumping modes, and a combination of pumping and swinging modes. We characterize these responses and report how they affect the sliding speed of the droplet along the fibre. The swinging mode is explained by a minimal model making an analogy between the droplet and a forced elastic pendulum.},
